# 🐄 Smart Cattle Monitoring System for Precision Livestock Farming
## Contribution:
Online Wok Wi & Blynk Simulation, Hardware Integration

## Executive Summary
The Smart Cattle Monitoring System aims to modernize traditional livestock practices by integrating IoT-based monitoring using the Blynk IoT platform. It focuses on:

- Monitoring cattle count

- Tracking body temperature

- Generating alerts for abnormal conditions

When a cattle's temperature exceeds 40°C, the system activates an LED alert for timely intervention. Strategically placed sensors and reflective collars improve detection accuracy and night visibility. This system ensures a safer, more efficient, and tech-savvy approach to livestock management.

## Project Objective
Implement an IoT-based system for real-time cattle monitoring

Integrate temperature and presence detection sensors

Use the Blynk IoT platform for remote access and data visualization

Enable proactive herd health management

Empower farmers through data-driven insights

## Scope
Integration of temperature and motion sensors

Real-time data updates via Blynk IoT

Configuration of user-friendly dashboards

Reliable wireless communication protocols

Rigorous testing and validation

Development of training and documentation materials
